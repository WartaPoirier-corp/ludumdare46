    "You are a parasite from the planet Pairduh, and you must survive by parasitizing a living being on Earth. If it dies, you die. Your goal is to control your host during the day to make it live, without understanding everything about what's happening around you (remember, you're an alien). But be careful ! When you do crazy actions, humans will be suspicious toward the host and could send it to the vet, where you could be discovered. You'll have to act like a normal living being.",
    "During your progression, you'll discover that you can reach different parts of your host's brain to gain access to clearer information about their senses. The choice will be up to you. Think carefully.",
    "As you approach Earth, you see four potential hosts for you to live on, all with their pros and cons, but some easier than others..."
