# Parasist

Parasist is the game we made for the 46th Ludum Dare. The theme was *Keep it alive*, so we made a game were
you are a parasite making choice for the animal hosting you, in order to keep it alive as long as possible,
so that you can yourself survive.

The game is [available online](https://parasists.argupedia.org).
